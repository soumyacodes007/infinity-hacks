# 🧠 Neurologist Agent Demo Summary

This document summarizes the Neurologist agent capabilities demonstrated.

## Key Features

- **Skill Preservation Detection**: Automatically compares model performance before/after treatment
- **Severity Classification**: Categorizes degradation as SAFE, CAUTION, or CRITICAL
- **Adaptive Recommendations**: Generates specific hyperparameter adjustments
- **Domain Analysis**: Evaluates math, reasoning, writing, and factual knowledge separately
- **Rich Reporting**: Provides detailed reports in JSON and markdown formats

## Scenarios Tested

### Safe Treatment

- **Verdict**: SAFE
- **Overall Degradation**: 1.0%
- **Key Recommendation**: ✅ SAFE: Skills well preserved

### Caution Treatment

- **Verdict**: CAUTION
- **Overall Degradation**: 9.0%
- **Key Recommendation**: ⚠️ CAUTION: Moderate skill degradation detected

### Critical Treatment

- **Verdict**: CRITICAL
- **Overall Degradation**: 31.2%
- **Key Recommendation**: 🚨 CRITICAL: Severe skill degradation detected

## Integration with Oumi

The Neurologist agent integrates with Oumi's evaluation framework:

- Uses `@register_evaluation_function` for skill domain judges
- Leverages `InferenceEngine.infer()` for model responses
- Connects to `Evaluator.evaluate()` for scoring
- Feeds recommendations to training config generation
