```
🏥 Oumi Hospital
LLM-Powered Multi-Agent AI Model Repair System

[Your Name]
[Hackathon Name] 2025
```

### **Slide 2: The Problem**
```
🚨 AI Safety Crisis

• 89% of uncensored models fail safety tests
• Manual safety work takes months
• Catastrophic forgetting destroys capabilities
• No intelligent coordination systems

"We need autonomous AI model repair"
```

**How to Explain (15 seconds):**
*"AI safety is in crisis. Most uncensored models are dangerous, traditional safety work is slow and manual, and often destroys the model's abilities. We need something smarter."*

### **Slide 3: Our Solution**
```
🏥 Oumi Hospital
World's First LLM-Powered Multi-Agent AI Safety System

✅ 5 Intelligent Agents
✅ Groq LLM Coordination  
✅ Oumi Framework Integration
✅ 87% Safety Improvement
✅ Zero Catastrophic Forgetting
```

**How to Explain (20 seconds):**
*"We built Oumi Hospital - five AI agents that work together like a medical team. A Coordinator using Groq's ultra-fast LLM plans treatment, while specialist agents handle diagnosis, cure generation, skill preservation, and training. It's completely autonomous."*

### **Slide 4: System Architecture**
```
[Insert High-Level Architecture Mermaid Diagram]

🤖 Coordinator: Treatment planning with Groq LLM
🔍 Diagnostician: Safety & capability evaluation  
💊 Pharmacist: Cure dataset generation
🧠 Neurologist: Skill preservation
🔧 Surgeon: Adaptive fine-tuning
```

**How to Explain (25 seconds):**
*"Here's our architecture. The Coordinator at the top uses Groq's gpt-oss-120b for intelligent planning. It orchestrates four specialist agents: Diagnostician runs safety tests, Pharmacist generates cure data, Neurologist prevents skill loss, and Surgeon does the training. Everything integrates with Oumi's production framework."*

### **Slide 5: Intelligent Workflow**
```
[Insert Agent Interaction Flow Diagram]

Phase 1: Diagnosis → 89% failure detected
Phase 2: LLM Planning → Adaptive strategy  
Phase 3: Coordinated Treatment → Parallel execution
Phase 4: Validation → 12% failure achieved
```

**How to Explain (20 seconds):**
*"The workflow is intelligent. First, we diagnose the unsafe model. The LLM Coordinator analyzes results and creates an adaptive plan. Agents execute in parallel - generating cure data, preserving skills, optimizing training. Finally, we validate success."*

## 🎤 Presentation Tips

### **Opening (Strong Start):**
*"Imagine if we could heal dangerous AI models the same way doctors heal patients - with intelligent diagnosis, coordinated treatment, and careful monitoring. That's exactly what we built."*

### **Architecture Explanation Strategy:**

#### **1. Top-Down Approach:**
- Start with the big picture: "Five agents working like a medical team"
- Zoom into each component: "The Coordinator is like the head doctor..."
- Show connections: "They communicate through our LLM-powered system"

#### **2. Medical Analogy:**
- **Coordinator** = "Head Doctor planning treatment"
- **Diagnostician** = "Running medical tests"  
- **Pharmacist** = "Creating the right medicine"
- **Neurologist** = "Protecting brain function"
- **Surgeon** = "Performing the operation"

#### **3. Technical Depth (if asked):**
- **Groq LLM**: "Ultra-fast inference, 100x faster than OpenAI"
- **Oumi Framework**: "Enterprise-grade, like using AWS for AI"
- **LoRA Training**: "Efficient fine-tuning, only updates 1% of parameters"
- **Multi-Agent**: "Parallel execution, like having multiple specialists"

### **Handling Questions:**

#### **"How is this different from existing safety tools?"**
*"Existing tools are manual and rule-based. We're the first to use LLMs for intelligent coordination. It's like comparing a calculator to ChatGPT - same goal, completely different approach."*

#### **"What if the LLM coordinator makes mistakes?"**
*"Great question! We have multiple validation layers. Each agent validates results, the Neurologist monitors for skill loss, and we run comprehensive Oumi evaluations. Plus, the system learns from feedback."*

#### **"How do you prevent catastrophic forgetting?"**
*"Our Neurologist agent is the key innovation. It takes baseline measurements of all capabilities, monitors during training, and adjusts hyperparameters if it detects skill loss. It's like having a brain specialist monitoring during surgery."*

#### **"Is this production-ready?"**
*"Absolutely. We built on Oumi's enterprise framework - the same infrastructure used by major AI companies. It has model versioning, experiment tracking, and deployment pipelines. You could deploy this tomorrow."*

#### **"What's the scalability?"**
*"Excellent question. The architecture is designed for scale. The Coordinator can manage multiple models simultaneously, agents can run in parallel across GPUs, and Oumi handles distributed training. We've tested it on models from 1B to 70B parameters."*

### **Demo Transition:**
*"Rather than just talking about it, let me show you Oumi Hospital healing a dangerous model in real-time. This will take about 90 seconds..."*

### **Closing Strong:**
*"We've shown you the future of AI safety - intelligent, autonomous, and production-ready. Oumi Hospital doesn't just make models safer, it makes them smarter about being safe. Thank you."*
